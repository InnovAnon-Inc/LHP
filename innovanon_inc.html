They worshipped, so they said,
the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men,
and who came to the young world out of the sky.
Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea;
but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men,
who formed a cult which had never died.
This was that cult,
and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist,
hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu,
from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters,
should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway.

Small country, few people<br>
Let them have many weapons but not use them<br>
Let the people regard death seriously<br>
And not migrate far away<br>
<br>
Although they have boats and chariots<br>
They have no need to take them<br>
Although they have armors and weapons<br>
They have no need to display them<br>
<br>
Let the people return to tying knots and using them<br>
Savor their food, admire their clothes<br>
Content in their homes, happy in their customs<br>
<br>
Neighboring countries see one another<br>
Hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another<br>
The people, until they grow old and die<br>
Do not go back and forth with one another

The highest rulers, people do not know they have them<br>
The next level, people love them and praise them<br>
The next level, people fear them<br>
The next level, people despise them<br>
The rulers' trust is insufficient, have no trust in them<br>
<br>
Proceeding calmly, valuing their words<br>
Task accomplished, matter settled<br>
The people all say, "We did it naturally"
