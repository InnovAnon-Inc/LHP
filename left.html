The <abbr title="Eternal">Sanatan</abbr> <abbr title="Life-Way">Dharma</abbr>
is a broad spectrum of philosophies and religious practices.<br>
<br>
Our tradition focuses on practical applications,
rather than adhering to <a href="dogmas/index.html">specific dogmas</a>.
Devotees have the liberty of believing various theories and interpretations
and may dedicate themselves to sundry <a href="meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">deities</a>,
and are encouraged to base their beliefs off their <a href="basics/darshan_siddhi.html">first-hand experiences</a>
resulting from <a href="basics/lucid_dreaming.html">daily practice</a>.<br>

If religion were true, its
followers would not try to
bludgeon their young into an
artificial conformity; but
would merely insist on their
unbending quest for truth,
irrespective of artificial
background or practical
consequences.

The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from
the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from
everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from the spell of the daily routine to
respond to tappings from outside, and tales of ordinary feelings and events, or of
common sentimental distortions of such feelings and events, will always take first
place in the taste of the majority; rightly, perhaps, since of course these ordinary
matters make up the greater part of human experience.
