The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from
the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from
everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from the spell of the daily routine to
respond to tappings from outside, and tales of ordinary feelings and events, or of
common sentimental distortions of such feelings and events, will always take first
place in the taste of the majority; rightly, perhaps, since of course these ordinary
matters make up the greater part of human experience.
