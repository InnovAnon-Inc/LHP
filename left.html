(a.k.a. "Hindoo -ism")
is a broad spectrum of philosophies and religious practices.<br>
<br>
Our tradition focuses on practical applications,
rather than adhering to <a href="dogmas/index.html">specific dogmas</a>.
Devotees have the liberty of believing various theories and interpretations
and may dedicate themselves to sundry <a href="meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">deities</a>,
and are encouraged to base their beliefs off their <a href="basics/darshan_siddhi.html">first-hand experiences</a>
resulting from <a href="basics/lucid_dreaming.html">daily practice</a>.<br>

If religion were true, its
followers would not try to
bludgeon their young into an
artificial conformity; but
would merely insist on their
unbending quest for truth,
irrespective of artificial
background or practical
consequences.

The Left Hand and the Right Hand are members on the same body.
Whereas devotees of the Right Hand (from the Latin "legitimus") Path
follow the tried and true formulae given by prophets and adepts to the masses,
devotees of the Left Hand (from the Latin "sinistra") seek to forge their own way
in the spirit of the original prophets and adepts.<br>
<br>
The LHP is adversarial and offensive to ingrained conditioning and the delusion of false ego.
By its own principles, it is the path for the few,
but provides balance to and prevents stagnation in the RHP.
Ultimately, all paths lead to <a href="basics/turiya.html">union</a> with the Brahman.

The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from
the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from
everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from the spell of the daily routine to
respond to tappings from outside, and tales of ordinary feelings and events, or of
common sentimental distortions of such feelings and events, will always take first
place in the taste of the majority; rightly, perhaps, since of course these ordinary
matters make up the greater part of human experience.

When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises<br>
When it knows good as good, evil arises<br>
<br>
Thus being and non-being produce each other<br>
Difficult and easy bring about each other<br>
Long and short reveal each other<br>
High and low support each other<br>
Music and voice harmonize each other<br>
Front and back follow each other<br>
<br>
Therefore the sages:<br>
Manage the work of detached actions<br>
Conduct the teaching of no words<br>
<br>
They work with myriad things but do not control<br>
They create but do not possess<br>
They act but do not presume<br>
<br>
They succeed but do not dwell on success<br>
It is because they do not dwell on success<br>
That it never goes away
