<h1 class="hard-to-see">Null Meditation</h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">Just sit there and don't do anything.<br>
Contrasting with the <a href="dhyana/dhyana_meditation.html">Dhyana Meditations</a>,<br>
you don't visualize any particular <a href="dhyana/yantras/index.html">yantra</a>.<br>
Instead, you allow images to appear.</p>

All life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference
betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no
cause to value the one above the other.

Yield and remain whole<br>
Bend and remain straight<br>
Be low and become filled<br>
Be worn out and become renewed<br>
Have little and receive<br>
Have much and be confused<br>
<br>
Therefore the sages hold to the one as an example for the world<br>
Without flaunting oneself - and so is seen clearly<br>
Without presuming oneself - and so is distinguished<br>
Without praising oneself - and so has merit<br>
Without boasting about oneself - and so is lasting<br>
<br>
Because they do not contend, the world cannot contend with them<br>
What the ancients called "the one who yields and remains whole"<br>
Were they speaking empty words?<br>
Sincerity becoming whole, and returning to oneself
