<h1>Theta Meditation</h1>
<p>Accelerate your progress by using binaural, isochronic or monaural beats in the theta range.<br>
Minimum ~4hz; maximum ~7.83hz; is optimal.<br>
Lower binaural frequencies will be ineffective at this stage.<br>
The practitioner should be able to audiate this frequency.</p>

<p>Success will be easily determined--you will feel as though you are falling.</p>

<p>At this level of achievement,<br>
the practitioner can begin the <a href="../../../basics/vision_quest.html">Greater Vision Quest</a>.</p>

<p>If losing consciousness is a problem,<br>
then meditate with something in your hand.<br>
When you fall asleep, your hand should release the object.<br>
Be sure to hold an object which will clatter on the floor and wake you.</p>
