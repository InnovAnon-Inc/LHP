<h1>Theta Meditation</h1>
<p>Accelerate your progress by using binaural, isochronic or monaural beats in the theta range.<br>
Lower binaural frequencies will be ineffective at this stage.<br>
The practitioner should be able to audiate this frequency.</p>

<p>Success will be easily determined--you will feel as though you are falling.</p>

<p>If losing consciousness is a problem,
then meditate with something in your hand.
When you fall asleep, your hand should release the object.
Be sure to hold an object which will clatter on the floor and wake you.</p>
