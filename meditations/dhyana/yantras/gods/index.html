According to tradition, the Dark Gods are actual entities which exist in the acausal universe.
According to our spatial, causal perception, these beings may be regarded as 'timeless and chaotic'.<br>
<br>
Since our consciousness is by its nature partly acausal these entities can become manifest for us
if we possess the keys to reach the appropriate levels of consciousness.
What is termed the 'Abyss' seperates our everyday consciousness from the consciousness (and thus apprehension) of the Dark Gods.
The ordeal of the Abyss involves confronting these entities -- and accepting them for what they are,
that is, unbound by our illusion of opposites and the conflict of 'good' and 'evil'.</p>
