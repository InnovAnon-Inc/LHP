<h1 class="hard-to-see">Grimoires of the Eternal Dreamers</h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">
This is not any <a href="../../../../study/handbook.html">particular</a>
set of volumes,
but one which is personal to the devotee
and his/her <a href="../../../../left.html">path</a>,
patron <a href="../gods/index.html">deity</a>,
etc.<br>
<br>
Any particular devotee's records may be called by such a title,
but it is generally reserved for those records
which have been scribed or dictated by adepts
of such <a href="../../../../basics/turiya.html">attainment</a>
so as to themselves be called eternal.<br>
<br>
The Grimoires of the Eternal Dreamers contain
notes, designs, etc,
both of a theoretical and of a practical nature,
and records the devotee's journey to adeptship
and beyond.<br>
<br>
Often containing <a href="../../../../basics/darshan_siddhi.html">dictates given from on high</a>,
visions of <a href="../elements/index.html">far away places</a>,
secret <a href="../../../../definitions/daksine_kalike_mantra.html">formulae</a>,
personal <a href="../../../../study/music.html">hymns</a> and rites,
etc,
these volumes contain knowledge which is
<abbr title="hidden; secret">occult</abbr> and forbidden to the masses during this <a href="../../../../basics/aeon.html">Aeon</a>.<br>
<br>
The volumes penned by the most learned adepts,
indeed take on a sacred and even mythological character,
occasionally written in enciphered, obscure languages.
