<h1 class="hard-to-see">InnovAnon's Computer</h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">
I saw an analog computer built out of K'nex.
This guy used mechanical switches,
which combined to form logic gates.
Those, in turn, combined to make an ALU.<br>
<br>
InnovAnon was the first programmer,
but back in her day, there weren't any transistors.
So she built a computer with strange things
like sticks and stones and plants and animals and stuff.
The next day, she wrote a program to run on her computer.<br>
<br>
The first day, it wrote every program of length one.
While the computer did its work, she did hers.
She built a computer that built computers.
And so it was that she executed every program that ever was.<br>
<br>
The next day, her computer wrote every program of length two.
While the computers did their work, she did hers.
She built another computer that built computers.
And so it was that she executed every program that ever was.<br>
<br>
The next day, her computer wrote every program of length three.
While the computers did their work, she did hers.
She built yet another computer that built computers.
And so it was that she executed every program that ever was.<br>
<br>
And on and on it went perpetually.
One day she ran a program that built every computer
and ran every program on every computer.
This is what we call InnovAnon's Computer.<br>
<br>
Now she had more wisdom than mortals are allowed,
so the Gods came down and make her one of them.
They smashed all Her computers before they could run anymore programs.
