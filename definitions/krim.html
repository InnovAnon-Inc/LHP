This is Goddess Kali beej mantra. Kali Mata gives us health, strength, all round success and protects from evil powers. This mantra creates a strong base for Kali Mahavidya Sadhana. In this mantra ‘ Ka ' is Maa Kali , ‘ Ra ' is Brahman, and ‘ ee ' is Mahamaya. ‘ Nada ' is the Mother of the Universe, and bindu is the dispeller of sorrow.
