<p>
This mantra contains 22 syllables and is said to be particularly strong.
It contains the Bija mantra of Kali -- bija mantras are known as tools
that use the power of sound to expand a person's mind -- and refers to Kali
in her form as the protector.
It also relates to the path of the sun across the equator at the autumn equinox.
