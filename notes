enemies drop all their shit
but shit gets super fucked up after battle

consumables are gp sinks
need to spawn fewer resources needed for crafting consumables

gp can pay for extra cpu/ram for your AI's container?
and for more AIs? significantly more, since it would have to outweigh the benefit of making two free accounts

can pay significant amounts of xp + gp to increase stats
