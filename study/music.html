<h1 class="hard-to-see">Music</h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">
Music and other <a href="../basics/creativity.html">creative technologies</a> are
quintessential skills for serenading the <a href="../meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">gods</a>,
chanting <a href="">mantras</a>, etc.
</p>

<p class="hard-to-see">
<a href="../about.html">InnovAnon</a> likes instruments which are simple
to make and simple to play. They should be tuned to experimental base frequencies
and using experimental tunings (NOT temperaments).
</p>
<ul class="hard-to-see">
<li>Singing</li>
<li>Clapping</li>
<li>Drum</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flutopedia.com/calculators.htm">Flute</a></li>
<li>Monochord (both plucked and bowed)</li>
</ul>

<p class="hard-to-see">
Musical parts should be simple enough for a non-musician to play during
ceremonies. Each musician may improvise and otherwise embellish his/her assigned part.

It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known;
and some of their women and children had disappeared
since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating
far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured.
There were insane shouts and harrowing screams,
soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames;
and, the frightened messenger added,
the people could stand it no more.

The five colors make one blind in the eyes<br>
The five sounds make one deaf in the ears<br>
The five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth<br>
<br>
Racing and hunting make one wild in the heart<br>
Goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage<br>
<br>
Therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes<br>
That is why they discard the other and take this
