<h1>Handbook of Holiness</h1>
<p>
The True Gods created and are embodied in nature and the Earth.
They are offended by that which is deemed unnatural,
including domestication of plants and animals,
construction of civilizations, etc.
Since the beginning of civilization,
our ancestors have made offerings to the True Gods,
in order to placate Their wrath
for our sins against Them and against nature.
</p>
<p>
Humans, created by the True Gods,
have our purpose encoded into our DNA.
The Sanatan Dharma is itself eternal
in that specific traditions
may arise from and disappear back into the dust,
and yet the spirit of the thing itself
is always reincarnated in these traditions.
</p>
<p>
We accept the original holy texts of mankind as Gospel Truth,
yet acknowledge that most have been altered to different degrees
throughout the ages.
As such, devotees are encouraged to learn about and even practice
paths and read texts other than our own,
but are reminded to beware of such alterations.
</p>
<p>
There are unholy spirits filled with enmity for the True Gods.
Throughout the ages, they have induced mankind to forget our Dharma,
and to turn away from our worship of the True Gods and
our completion of our purpose.
Indeed, during the Ignorant Aeons,
the masses forget the True Gods,
worshiping them only nominally,
and actually serving lesser entities.

<p>
Suppose you are a fan of your local sports team.
Would you, then, give your time and money to their rival team instead?
This is indeed the state of the masses during the Ignorant Ages.
During these ages, mankind's ability of True Sight is dampened,
and fewer are able to attain Darshan of the True Gods,
and therefore we turn away from Them,
instead to be influenced by Their enemies.
