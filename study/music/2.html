I'd like to explore the seventh mood--the darkest mood--the unresolving mood.

This piece is in C Locrian. (play scale)

I'd like to really feel that diminished starting chord.

A long, long time ago when I was little,
I saw a vision of an old lady with the body of a man.
I called her Muscle Grandma.
Muscle Grandma was a superhero,
but she didn't fight crime like normal superheroes.
Normal heroes fight robbers each day,
and each day begin again with the same work.
At that age I didn't know the story of Sisyphus.
Well anyway, Mucle Grandma was old and clever,
so she'd fix the things that made the robbers want to steal.
That way the other superheroes could take a break sometimes.
And she was a granny,
so she gave people cookies and cakes.
One Samhain, "Halloween" to me at the time,
I dressed as Muscle Grandma,
and went to the festival at a church.



I'd also like to tell you a story.
This is a true story.

The Big Bad Wolf begins by eating everyone.
He proceeds to shit everywhere and on everything.
I guess he's got some sort of shitting disorder.
Anyway, The End inevitably comes,
and a little old lady kicks his ass in self-defense
and then he has to clean up all his shit
and help fix the things he broke.

Lyrics
Once upon a time the Wolf ate everyone
He shit Lego bricks where people would step on them
He ate all our food and even took our magic
We pined weak and only the Wolf could do cool shit
He made himself king and shit on the food forest acres
He made gold and silver stones and green toilet papers
They called her wise old Grandma The End
She's been everywhere that everything's been
For ages and ages the Wolf trembled in fear
From the prophecies he knew The End was near
Indeed I saw riding out Four pale Horsemen
They said, "The End has come and we're replanting the Gardens."
Granny and her friends were gamey and tough and mean
They jumped right out and ruptured the Wolf's spleen
They ripped him a new one and put his ass to work
They taught him a lesson for being such a jerk
She made him give us his shiny rocks and green TPs
To get them back he spins the Hoops for Granny The End

Granny spake in a booming and manly voice
It shook the mountains 'cause she was once little a boy
She said, "Wolf! Go home or shut your stupid face
Clean up all your shit and fix the Gardens you erased."
