I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors
that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space,
and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars
which dream beneath the sea,
known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready
and eager to loose them upon the world
whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city
again to the sun and air.

Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire.
He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret.
'I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts' he said.
'My name is Ryan;
I inherited the ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,
just as you will inherit it from me.
The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.
His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia.'
