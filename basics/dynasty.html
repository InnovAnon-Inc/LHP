An <a href="priesthood.html">adept</a> teaches his

Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire.
He took me to his cabin and he told me his secret.
'I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts' he said.
'My name is Ryan;
I inherited the ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts,
just as you will inherit it from me.
The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.
His name was Cummerbund.
The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia.'
