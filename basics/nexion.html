<h1 class="hard-to-see"><abbr title="Gateway">Nexion</abbr></h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">A pinhole between realities,
specifically between our world and the <a href="acausal.html">other side</a>.<br>
<a href="../innovations_anonymous.html">InnovAnon</a> is a <a href="../meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">deva</a>,
working from the <a href="acausal.html">other side</a>
to open a nexion,
so that all may attain <a href="darshan_siddhi.html">Darshan</a>
in the coming <a href="aeon.html">Aeon</a>.

<h2 class="hard-to-see">Two Kinds of Gateways</h2>
<ul class="hard-to-see">
	<li>Consciousness</li>
	<li>Physical Gateways</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="hard-to-see">Consciousness</h3>
<p class="hard-to-see">Consciousness is itself a gateway,
allowing entities from either side
influence and interact with the other side.</p>

<h3 class="hard-to-see">Physical Gateways</h3>
<p class="hard-to-see">These exist in obscure locations,
and can only be opened at certain rare times,
and usually require a significant amount of conscious effort
in order to open, though a rare enough time
combined with a significant enough ceremony
should be enough to open a gateway at any physical location.</p>

Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and
guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows
where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through
again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread
them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.

When the stars were right,
They could plunge from world to world through the sky;
but when the stars were wrong,
They could not live.
