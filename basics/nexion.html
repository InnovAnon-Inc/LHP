Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and
guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows
where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through
again. He knows where They have trod earth's fields, and where They still tread
them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread.
