The Machines in the real world are all connected to a "singular consciousness", the birth of Artificial Intelligence described by Morpheus in the first Matrix film. This consciousness is otherwise known as "the Source". The machine connection is a remote one or some sort of wireless signal. Having touched the Source (i.e. meeting with the Architect) and having the data needed to reboot the Matrix, Neo is, at this point, simultaneously in possession of his human brain but also connected to the singular consciousness. In other words, his is also now a wireless connection. Hence the reason Neo says, "Something's different. I can feel them." The Machines are all separate entities but all connected to this one Source. Now, Neo is connected as well. He is thereby able to harness this power and stop the Sentinels. However, Neo wasn't ready to handle the signal surge at the end of Reloaded and collapsed in a comatose state, no longer in control of just where this wireless signal would be directed. The signal (Neo's residual self-image) is then captured and held in a program limbo derived from the Source but undetected as an existing realm, so to speak. This limbo (the "Mobil Ave" train station) was created by the Trainman (Bruce Spence), a program in service to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). This connection forged by Neo's visit to the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis) and his subsequent decision to return to the real world made him, unknowingly, unique. Neo became simultaneously human and machine in a sense.
