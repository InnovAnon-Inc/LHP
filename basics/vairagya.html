<h1 class="hard-to-see"><abbr title="The Calling">Vairagya</abbr></h1>
<p class="hard-to-see">
A <a href="../meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">God</a>
takes notice of you and causes you to enter His/Her service,
instilling in your heart and mind a deep desire for union with that
God, resulting in single-minded devotion.<br>
<br>
Though, at first, this may manifest
as being drawn to certain aspects of spiritual attainment,
such as <abbr title="Worldly Powers">riddhis</abbr>
and <a href="siddhi.html"><abbr title="Spiritual Powers">siddhis</abbr></a>,
rather than the nobler endeavor of union with the Divine,
the ultimate result of any legitimate path is a
<a href="../meditations/dhyana/dhyana_meditation.html">death of the false ego</a>
and the transformation of the self--a surrender
of self in the service of the Divine and a sort of purity of heart
that will exude one's virtues which are obscured by the false egos
of the untrained masses.<br>
<br>
In <a href="creativity.html">performing services</a> to that God,
including <a href="alchemy.html">cultivating</a> your
<a href="turiya.html">consciousness</a> to
<a href="darshan_siddhi.html">better serve</a> Him/Her,
you will begin to pursue various spiritual practices,
such as <a href="../meditations/meditation.html">meditation</a>,
often renouncing the world and undertaking intense ceremonies.
This is the Calling to ministerial and spiritual services.
</p>
<p class="hard-to-see">
This step is prerequisite to all spiritual endeavors;
in a way, it is the most difficult,
yet in a way, it is the easiest.
The Calling is rare,
and most people will not experience it in this lifetime.
Indeed, it occurs only in those lucky enough to be blessed by a God.
However, if you are here,
then you have it, at least to some degree.<br>
<br>
Your next step is to answer the Calling.
This site and many others proffer examples of ways to do so,
but this is unnecessary,
as the <a target="_blank"

>Dharma</a> is eternal,
and having heard the Call,
you know will know what to do,
at least at some level.<br>
<br>
You will find mundane existence dissatisfactory and hollow,
and will have to turn to service of your patron deity
in order to find any solace.
