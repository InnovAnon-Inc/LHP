<p>This process varies from tradition to tradition.<br>
In some traditions, it is a series of meditations, including mantras, yantras, mudras, etc.<br>

In order for this to be effective, at a minimum<br>
the practitioner must be able to do <a href="../meditations/dhyana/levels/theta_meditation.html">theta meditation</a>.<br>
