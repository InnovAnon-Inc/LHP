	<p class="hard-to-see">
Also known as "cowans," "muggles," etc. Have fun with it.<br>
<br>
This class of birth is considered lower than any plant or animal life.
They are so hated by the <a href="../meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">Gods</a>,
that they are continuously reincarnated,
each time losing (nearly) 100% of their
<a href="../char.html">skills and abilities</a>,
never even having the <a href="vairagya.html">desire</a> to
<a href="turiya.html">break free</a> from that cycle.<br>
<br>
Damned to run the worldly race again and again without any true
<a href="lucid_dreaming.html">autonomy</a>,
these poor souls are concerned only with perpetuating their miserable,
however fleeting, causal existence.
Shirking their true purpose as instilled in all men by the Gods,
they seek in their wordly accumulations and accomplishments
a fulfillment which eternally eludes them.<br>
<br>
Lacking in purity of heart and therefore failing to exude the virtues
imbued by the Gods within their spirits,
they often act under the influence of the adversaries of the Gods,
usually, but not always unwittingly.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.joyofsatan.org/Freeing_the_Soul.html">Shun</a> them,
for consciousness is contagious.
Dwell always within the congregation of the holy
and within <a href="darshan_siddhi.html">Sight</a> of the Divine.
