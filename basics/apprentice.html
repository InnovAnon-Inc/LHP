A <a href="priesthood.html">priest</a> takes you under his wing;
guiding your study and practice.
You will inherit the favor of his/her patron
<a href="../meditations/dhyana/yantras/gods/index.html">deity</a>.
(S)he may transmit to you a secret mantra or ceremony.
You will be given instruction to assist in your passing the
